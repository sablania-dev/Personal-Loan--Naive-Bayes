 This project is a part of the course CS60020: Foundations of Algorithm Design and Machine Learning, Spring 2025, IIT Kharagpur. This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for predicting whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer. The dataset used is `loan.csv`, which contains customer information and the target variable `Personal Loan`.
